### This directory contains all the preliminaries required for the project.

The project mainly uses Keras with TensorFlow as backend. The source code and results are in the src and plots directory, respectively. Following are the various tutorials worked out:

(Visit the link for the codes and results obtained from the tutorials.)

1. [GWOSC](https://github.com/Chaitany1729/trac2019/tree/master/ligo_tutorials)
2. Pycbc

For Neural Networks, following tutorials are worked out:
1. [Image Classification on MNIST Data Set](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification):
This tutorial is for baisc handson with the neural network, roc plots and effect of noise on the classification.
 
2. [Audio Classification using CNN](https://github.com/mikesmales/Udacity-ML-Capstone/blob/master/Notebooks/4%20Model%20Refinement.ipynb):
A basic four layer CNN model is bulit as per the tutorial. This model classifies the audio [data set](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html) with ten classes. The results are roc plot for the class car_horn is shown as sample result. The overall testing accuracy was found to be 86.34%.
